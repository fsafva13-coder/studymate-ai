# StudyMate AI

StudyMate AI is an AI-powered study assistant built as part of the **Decoding Data Science (DDS) – Building AI Applications Challenge 2026**.

The project focuses on helping students understand academic concepts more clearly through simple explanations, structured learning points, and study guidance.

## Problem

Students often struggle with:
- Understanding complex or abstract topics  
- Lack of structured study guidance  
- Feeling overwhelmed or demotivated during self-study  

---

## Solution

StudyMate AI provides:
- Simple, beginner-friendly explanations  
- Key learning points in a clear, structured format  
- Practical study tips and learning strategies  
- Motivational support to encourage consistent studying  

---

## How It Works

- Users enter a study-related question via a chat interface  
- The AI processes the input using a prompt-driven workflow  
- Responses are generated with clear explanations and supportive guidance suitable for beginners  

---

## Tech Stack

- **AIRIA** – No-Code AI Platform (Chat Widget & Prompt Workflow)  
- **Prompt Engineering** – Core application logic  
- **GitHub** – Documentation and proof-of-work  

---

## Current Status (After Day 3)

- AIRIA environment configured successfully  
- Chat-based AI workflow implemented and tested  
- Core prompt logic (“brain” of the app) created  
- Initial baseline testing completed using sample study questions  
- Project documentation updated

## Example Questions Tested

- “Explain recursion like I’m a beginner”  
- “Give me study tips for computer science exams”  
- “Summarize photosynthesis in simple words”  
- “How can I study effectively with limited time?”
- "What is the difference between hardware and software in simple terms?"
- "Explain what an operating system does using an easy example."
- "What is an exam revision plan for one week?"
- "Explain the concept of variables as if I have never coded before."
- "How can I stay focused while studying at home?"
- "What are effective note-taking methods for students?"

## Next Steps

- Improve prompt quality and response consistency  
- Add a structured study-planning feature  
- Enhance output formatting and user experience  
- Prepare demo video and final submission assets
