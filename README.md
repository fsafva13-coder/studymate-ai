# StudyMate AI

StudyMate AI is an AI-powered study assistant built as part of the **Decoding Data Science (DDS) – Building AI Applications Challenge 2026**.

The project focuses on helping students understand academic concepts more clearly through simple explanations, structured learning points, and study guidance.

## 🏆 Achievement

This project secured **Second Prize in the AIRIA Track** and an overall **13th Rank among 576 participants**
at the *Decoding Data Science AI Application Challenge 2026*.

This was my first time building and deploying an AI application.

## Problem

Students often struggle with:
- Understanding complex or abstract topics  
- Lack of structured study guidance  
- Feeling overwhelmed or demotivated during self-study  

---

## Solution

StudyMate AI provides:
- Simple, beginner-friendly explanations  
- Key learning points in a clear, structured format  
- Practical study tips and learning strategies  
- Motivational support to encourage consistent studying  

---

## How It Works

- Users enter a study-related question via a chat interface  
- The AI processes the input using a prompt-driven workflow  
- Responses are generated with clear explanations and supportive guidance suitable for beginners  

---

## Tech Stack

- **AIRIA** – No-Code AI Platform (Chat Widget & Prompt Workflow)  
- **Prompt Engineering** – Core application logic  
- **GitHub** – Documentation and proof-of-work  

---

## Current Status (After Day 3)

- AIRIA environment configured successfully  
- Chat-based AI workflow implemented and tested  
- Core prompt logic (“brain” of the app) created  
- Initial baseline testing completed using sample study questions  
- Project documentation updated  

---

## Example Questions Tested

- “Explain recursion like I’m a beginner”  
- “Give me study tips for computer science exams”  
- “Summarize photosynthesis in simple words”  
- “How can I study effectively with limited time?”
- "What is the difference between hardware and software in simple terms?"
- "Explain what an operating system does using an easy example."
- "What is an exam revision plan for one week?"
- "Explain the concept of variables as if I have never coded before."
- "How can I stay focused while studying at home?"
- "What are effective note-taking methods for students?"

---

## Next Steps

- Improve prompt quality and response consistency  
- Add a structured study-planning feature  
- Enhance output formatting and user experience  
- Prepare demo video and final submission assets  

---

## Progress Update (Day 4)

- Refined the system prompt based on testing results
- Evaluated AI responses for clarity, structure, and beginner-friendliness
- Added safety and validation rules within the no-code workflow
- Improved response consistency through prompt iteration

---

## Progress Update (Day 5)

- Integrated the AI logic with a user-facing chat interface using AIRIA
- Verified end-to-end interaction from user input to AI response
- Improved system prompt for better UX, clarity, and validation handling
- Tested the interface with multiple user scenarios and edge cases

---

## Progress Update (Day 6)

- Reviewed input handling and clarified accepted question formats
- Added safety and validation logic through system prompt constraints
- Verified API keys are securely managed within the platform (no secrets in repo)
- Improved response consistency and clarity
- Cleaned documentation and usage notes

---

## Project Update — (Day 7)

### Current Capabilities

- Accepts open-ended study-related questions
- Provides clear, beginner-friendly explanations with simple examples
- Offers practical study tips and motivational support
- Designed for non-technical users with a chat-based interface

### Deployment

- Platform: AIRIA (No-Code AI Agent)
- Interface: Chat Widget + API
- Status: Published and live (v2.0.0)

### Demo & Evidence

- Screenshots of the working agent and interface included in the repository
- Explainer video recorded describing the workflow, interface, and functionality
- GitHub used as a central hub for documentation and proof-of-work

### Notes

This project prioritizes clarity, usability, and responsible AI behavior. The focus was on delivering a stable, supportive learning experience rather than implementing complex engineering features.
